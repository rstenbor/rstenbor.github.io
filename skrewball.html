                   The goal of this project was to design, plan out, and shoot a photo of a product to be used for advertising. I chose to do my shoot with Screwball Whiskey, which features an interesting peanut butter flavor. I included a mountain of peanuts in the shot to try to sell that peanut butter flavor.

                    Since the setup of this project was completely up to me, the layout of the shot and the lighting setup was entirely dependant on how I wanted the final piece to look. My vision was of a dusty old barn with sunlight pouring through the broken roof and walls at sunset. To accomplish this, I set the softbox over and in front of the spread to create a soft, even light, and added a bright snoot light behind the subject off to the right to really light up the rocks glass and bring that sunset concept to life.

                    This project was a blast to work on. The original plan was to have an assistant ready in the wings to throw a small handful of dust over the subject spread during the shoot to add a dusty barn effect, but the dust fell too heavy and didn't look good. I added in a dusty effect in the top right corner in post and upped the contrast a little to add a bit more drama and wamrth to the piece.
