            <p>
                The goal of this project was to display an understanding of JavaScript. I had to present two of three different modules. For the modules, I chose a "product" section, which displays a product than can be switched out for another, and a "shop" section, which allows users to add items to a shopping cart. I also had to have a validated form with built-in error messages, and a dark mode switch to change the theme of the website.
            </p>

        <section id="outline">
            <h2>Outline & Process</h2>
            <img src="./Images/corsairOrig.png" alt="Screenshot of CORSAIR site">
            <p>
                I used CORSAIR as heavy inspiration for style and structure of this site, and all the product images were taken directly from CORSAIR.
            </p>
            <img src="./Images/corsairwf.png" alt="Wireframes of my CORSAIR site">
            <p>
                Since I had my inspiration chosen, I drew up some wireframes in Adobe XD to get my structure well defined. I didn't end up doing a full mockup after wireframing, because I was just applying the visual style of CORSAIR to a slightly different structure. 
            </p>
            <img src="./Images/selector.png" alt="Product Section">
            <p>
              The product section displays the first of three products, and a user can switch between all three. I used JavaScript to set the display of each content block to either "block" or "hidden" depending on whether or not it should be visible.
            </p>
            <img src="./Images/shop.png" alt="Shop section">
            <p>
              The shop section displays a bunch of different CORSAIR products, along with price information and a button to "Add to Order". At the bottom, the products added are displayed in a list, and the total cost, and cost after taxes, is displayed. Clicking "ORDER" clears the list and price values and alerts the client of the total.
            </p>
            <img src="./Images/form.png" alt="Form section">
            <p>
              The form section is rather simple in concept but required knowledge of REGEX expressions and other validation tactics. The user can choose between inputting a phone or email address. When "Submit" is clicked, the form checks that a name, a valid phone number or email address, and comments have been filled in. If all the conditions pass, the form alerts the user letting them know their info went through.
            </p>
